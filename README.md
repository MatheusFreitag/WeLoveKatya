# We Love Katya

## Overview
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katya_Zamolodchikova" target="_blank">Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova</a> (
your dad just calls her "Katya") is a Drag Queen that live in our hearts.
In order to show this affection I bring this Chrome Extension that replaces almost all images in your page for Katya's pictures.
Don't worry, is nothing permanent. You just need to realod your page and everything will be back to normal.

## Getting it
Simply download it from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/we-love-katya/lbcakgcpbinaifejpmgcfboofkdbmkjj" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> and install it as any other extension. 


## How does it work?
It replaces some of the images loaded in your browser for one picture of Katya. If you are in a progressive loaded page (Like Twitter or Facebook timelines) new images might not be replaced, but you just need to hit the extension button again and the magic will happen.
Want everything back to normal? Reload your page and it is done.



## Motivation
My personal motivation here was to praise Katya after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race" target="_blank"> RuPaul's 
Drag Race</a> - <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race:_All_Stars_(season_2)" target="_blank">All Stars Season 2</a>. 
Don't get me wrong (spoiler alert!!), I have a huge admiration for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Thunderfuck_5000" target="_blank">Alaska</a> and she is great, but Katya was my favorite and 
for me it was very sad to watch her lose. 
Now I can see her all over the internet - literally.


#### Note 
I don't own any image of Katya. All of them are from Google Images and if you see something that you own and you want it 
removed from this extension, send me an email at freitag.matheus@gmail.com
